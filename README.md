 Project Description

The Contact Database Application is a CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operation-based application designed to manage contacts. In this project, CRUD operations are performed using SQLite as the database to store and retrieve contact information. The application allows users to add new contacts, view existing contacts, update contact details, and delete contacts.

 Insights and Results
During the development of the Contact Database Application, CRUD operations were implemented using SQLite as the underlying database. The application was built using Node.js, providing a server-side runtime for JavaScript.

Insights:
- The Node.js environment facilitated efficient server-side development and handling of asynchronous operations.
- SQLite was chosen as the database due to its lightweight nature and ease of integration with Node.js.
- Adding contacts, viewing existing contacts, updating contact details, and deleting contacts were successfully implemented.

Challenges:
- Connecting SQLite to the Node.js code initially posed challenges, especially in terms of establishing a reliable connection.
- Debugging and resolving issues related to SQL queries and data retrieval.

Results:
- Successfully developed a Contact Database Application with CRUD functionality.
- Contacts can be added, viewed, updated, and deleted through a user-friendly interface.
- Overcame initial challenges, ensuring a smooth integration of SQLite with the Node.js application.
